## Rick Bayless's Oaxaca Picks

Chef Rick Bayless has been leading culinary tours to Oaxaca for 26+ years. Here's where he sends everyone:

### His "Last Meal" Spot: Mercado 20 de Noviembre

> *"This is where I would eat my last meal."* - Rick Bayless

**The Pasillo de Carnes Asadas (Meat Aisle)**:
- A smoky corridor of grills
- Order 150-200 grams of various meats at the stalls - they grill it for you
- Ladies come around with fresh tortillas
- Bayless says these are **"the best tortillas in the world"** - big, handmade, beautiful
- Richly-burnished chiles and onions alongside thin-sliced beef, pork, robust chorizo

**La Abuelita** (10 paces from the meat aisle):
- Been there nearly 100 years
- Hit it for **breakfast** (10am-12pm) for enchiladas, enfrijoladas, enmoladas
- Communal seating, very traditional

### Bayless's #1 Restaurant Pick: Los Danzantes

> *"I would eat here first and foremost."*

- Owned by the mezcal people (Danzantes and Alipus brands)
- "One of the coolest rooms in town"
- Modern/traditional food with excellent Mexican wines
- Their own mezcal line - order it
- **Reservations recommended**

### Other Bayless Favorites

## Food Tours (With Mexican National)

### Your Advantage

Since you're traveling with a Mexican national, you have access to more authentic experiences:
- **Skip the English-speaking tour premium** - save 30-50% on tours
- **Access local-only experiences** - some guides prefer Spanish-only groups
- **Better prices** - no tourist markup when booking directly
- **Deeper cultural context** - your partner can translate nuance and ask better questions

### Recommended Approach

1. **Skip formal tours** - Have your partner ask locals directly for recommendations
2. **Do a cooking class** - Seasons of My Heart, Me Encanta Oaxaca, or Reyna's are worth it even with a local companion
3. **Go to Zaachila on Thursday** - La Capilla + market, no tour needed
4. **Tlacolula Sunday Market** - Go on your own, it's easy and more authentic without a guide
5. **Caldo de Piedra day trip** - Easy drive, no tour needed, just show up

## Markets

| Market | Best For | Rick Bayless Says |
|--------|----------|-------------------|

| **Mercado Benito Juárez** | Chapulines, chocolate, crafts | Great and manageable |
| **Tlacolula Sunday Market** | Authentic village market | Freshly picked produce, tepache, pulque, smoked meats |
| **Mercado de Abastos** | Wholesale, overwhelming | "Wondrous and huge" - for adventurous eaters |
