## What Makes Mezcal "Artisanal"

| Type | Method | What to Look For |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Industrial** | Autoclaves, column stills, commercial yeast | Avoid - mass produced |
| **Artisanal** | Earthen pit roasting, copper/clay pots, natural yeast | This is what you want (92% of mezcal) |
| **Ancestral** | Clay pot distillation only, hand-crushed | The most traditional - seek it out |
