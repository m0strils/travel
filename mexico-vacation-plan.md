### Snorkeling Secret

At Playa Las Gatas, ask your guide to show you the **sunken bronze Christ statue** underwater - most tourists miss it.

If someone calls you **"zanca"** (or "zancas" plural) - it means friend/brother, like "dude." It's a sign of respect and means you've been accepted.

### Staying Connected

Websites here are often outdated. For real-time info:
- **Facebook**: "Zihuatanejo Let's Chat" and "Fun Things to do in Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa"
