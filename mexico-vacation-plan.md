## Why This Timing is Perfect

### Oaxaca Food & Wine Festival (Feb 25 - March 1, 2026)

The festival happens during your visit - but it's touristy and expensive. **Consider 1-2 events max** rather than going all-in:

| Event Type | Worth It? | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Mezcal-focused lunches** | ✅ Yes | Traditional pairings, educational |
| **Traditional cooking events** | ✅ Yes | Learn authentic techniques |
| **Fancy wine dinners** | ❌ Skip | Tourist prices, not authentic Oaxaca |

**Better approach**: Spend your time eating where locals eat (see Rick Bayless recommendations below) and doing your own mezcal exploration at palenques.

**If you do one event**: Pick a mezcal lunch or traditional cooking demonstration. Tickets at [oaxacafoodandwinefestival.com](https://oaxacafoodandwinefestival.com/)

Since you're traveling with a Mexican national, you have access to more authentic experiences:
- **Skip the English-speaking tour premium** - save 30-50% on tours
- **Access local-only experiences** - some guides prefer Spanish-only groups
- **Better prices** - no tourist markup when booking directly
- **Deeper cultural context** - your partner can translate nuance and ask better questions

### Best Food Tours in Oaxaca

3. **Go to Zaachila on Thursday** - La Capilla + market, no tour needed
4. **Tlacolula Sunday Market** - Go on your own, it's easy and more authentic without a guide

## What is a Temazcal Ceremony?

### The Ritual

| Element | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **Structure** | Dome-shaped lodge (igloo-like) made of volcanic stone, clay, or wood - represents the womb of Mother Earth |

| **Duration** | 1-2 hours typically |

### What to Expect

**Physically:**
- Intense heat (especially in later rounds)
- Increased heart rate and sweating
- Possible dizziness - communicate if you feel unwell

**Emotionally:**
- Many experience emotional release - crying, laughter, deep introspection
- Can be profoundly moving
- Symbolizes death and rebirth

**After:**
- Feel refreshed, rejuvenated, emotionally cleansed
- Fresh fruit and agua fresca typically shared
- You may feel tired - allow time to rest

| **Coyote Aventuras** | 4-day guided retreats with ceremonies - only available June-July | Summer only |

### How to Find a Guide (With Mexican National)

Your partner can help access guides that don't advertise to tourists:

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Safety Information for Bipolar Disorder

**This section is critical for your friend.**

### What Medical Research Shows

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Risk level** | ~1 in 3 people with bipolar disorder who use psilocybin report adverse effects |
| **Types of adverse effects** | New or worsening manic symptoms, sleep difficulties, anxiety |
| **Clinical trials** | Have historically EXCLUDED people with bipolar disorder |
| **Recent research** | Small studies on Bipolar II show promise, but data is limited |

### Absolute Contraindications

| ❌ NEVER combine with | Why |
|----------------------|-----|
| **LITHIUM** | **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** - risk of seizures |
| **Antipsychotics** | Blocks effects, unpredictable interactions |
| **SSRIs/MAOIs** | Risk of serotonin syndrome |

### If Your Friend Is Considering This

1. **Consult their psychiatrist first** - this is non-negotiable
2. **Bipolar I vs Bipolar II matters** - Bipolar I carries higher risk
3. **Medication status** - any medication changes require medical supervision
4. **Professional supervision strongly recommended** - not a casual decision
5. **Have a plan** - know how to contact mental health provider if symptoms worsen

### Harm Reduction if Proceeding

- Start with very low dose if at all
- Have a completely sober trip sitter present
- Monitor carefully for emerging manic symptoms (reduced sleep, increased energy, impulsivity)
- Track mood changes in days/weeks following
- Do NOT proceed if currently in unstable mood state

### The Bottom Line

Research suggests **lower risk than previously assumed** for Bipolar II, but risk is **real and significant**. This should only be considered with:
- Medical consultation
- Professional supervision
- Proper preparation and integration support

**The temazcal is a powerful, meaningful ceremonial experience that doesn't carry these risks.** Consider making that the focus.
