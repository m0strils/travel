## Accommodation Notes

### Toluca (3 nights: Jan 17-19)

| Option | Vibe | Location Tip |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Hotel** | Convenient, central | Stay near Centro Histórico for walkability |
| **Airbnb** | More space, kitchen | Good if visiting family nearby |
| **With family?** | If partner's family is there... | Best option if available! |

*Your partner likely knows the best areas - defer to her.*

### Zihuatanejo (4 nights: Jan 20-23)

| Area | Vibe | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **Playa La Ropa** | Beachfront, upscale | Walking out to sand, sunset views |
| **Downtown/Centro** | Local, walkable to pier | Restaurants, atmosphere, budget-friendly |
| **Playa Madera** | Quieter, between downtown and La Ropa | Balance of both |

**Festival week note**: Book early! Jan 22-25 may have higher demand.

**Recommended approach**:
- La Ropa if you want beach access out your door
- Downtown if you want to be in the action and walk to restaurants
