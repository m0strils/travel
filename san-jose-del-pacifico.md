## What is a Temazcal Ceremony?

A **temazcal** is an ancient Mesoamerican sweat lodge ceremony - far more than just a steam bath. The word means "house of heat" in Nahuatl.

### The Ritual

| Element | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **Structure** | Dome-shaped lodge (igloo-like) made of volcanic stone, clay, or wood - represents the womb of Mother Earth |
| **The Four Doors** | Ceremony divided into 4 parts (doors), each progressively hotter as new volcanic stones ("abuelas"/grandmothers) are added |
| **The Guide** | A temazcalero/a leads with songs, chants, meditation, drumming, prayers |
| **The Steam** | Water infused with medicinal herbs (sage, copal, local plants) poured over hot stones |
| **Duration** | 1-2 hours typically |

### What to Expect

**Physically:**
- Intense heat (especially in later rounds)
- Increased heart rate and sweating
- Possible dizziness - communicate if you feel unwell

**Emotionally:**
- Many experience emotional release - crying, laughter, deep introspection
- Can be profoundly moving
- Symbolizes death and rebirth

**After:**
- Feel refreshed, rejuvenated, emotionally cleansed
- Fresh fruit and agua fresca typically shared
- You may feel tired - allow time to rest

## Mushroom Tea & Guided Experiences

### Cabañas Pacífico (Tío's Place)

This is the original and most trusted spot - **"Tío"** opened it 20+ years ago.

| **How** | Ask for "Hongo" - staff brings mushrooms or prepares tea |
| **Setting** | Stunning nature views, peaceful |
| **Guidance** | Follow instructions from the grandmother who serves |
| **Reputation** | "Pretty much the one place in town that is most trusted" |

### Critical Timing Note

**You're visiting late February/early March - this is OFF-SEASON for fresh mushrooms.**

| Season | Availability |
|--------|--------------|
| **July-October** | Fresh mushrooms, best quality, cheapest |
| **November-June** | Dried mushrooms, tea, or preserved in honey only |

**Your options in late February:**
1. Mushroom tea at Tío's (preserved in honey - most reliable off-season)
2. Focus on temazcal as the ceremonial experience
3. Consider this a reconnaissance trip and return July-October

### Mushroom Foraging Tours & Other Options

| **Coyote Aventuras** | 4-day guided retreats with ceremonies - only available June-July | Summer only |

### How to Find a Guide (Spanish Helps)

Speaking Spanish opens doors to guides that don't advertise to tourists:
1. **Ask at Cabañas Pacífico directly** - Staff know everyone
2. **Talk to locals in town** - Small community, word of mouth
3. **Check at the small tiendas** - Shop owners often know guides
4. **Be patient** - Trust is earned, especially off-season

### What's Available Off-Season

| Form | Availability | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Fresh mushrooms** | Not available | Season is July-October only |
| **Dried mushrooms** | Limited | Ask locally, quality varies |

## A Note on Psilocybin & Bipolar Disorder

If someone in your group manages bipolar disorder, here's what current research says to help make an informed decision.

### What the Research Shows

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Mixed results** | Some people report positive experiences, others report challenges |
| **Bipolar II** | Recent small studies show promise, though data is still limited |
| **Clinical trials** | Have historically excluded people with bipolar disorder, so less is known |
| **Individual variation** | Responses vary significantly person to person |

### Important Medication Interactions

| Medication | Interaction |
|------------|-------------|
| **Lithium** | Significant safety concern - medical guidance essential |
| **Antipsychotics** | Can block effects or cause unpredictable interactions |
| **SSRIs/MAOIs** | Potential for serotonin syndrome |

### Things to Consider

- **Talk to a psychiatrist first** - they know your specific situation
- **Bipolar I vs II** - different risk profiles
- **Current stability** - timing matters
- **Support system** - having trusted people present
- **Integration plan** - how to process the experience afterward

### Harm Reduction Approach

If choosing to proceed after medical consultation:
- Start with a lower dose
- Have a trusted, sober person present
- Be in a calm, safe environment
- Have a plan for reaching support if needed
- Allow time afterward to rest and integrate

### Alternative: Temazcal

The temazcal ceremony offers a profound, transformative experience through heat, intention, and community - without the medication interaction concerns. Many people find it deeply meaningful. It can be a beautiful focus for the San José visit.
