## What is a Temazcal Ceremony?

A **temazcal** is an ancient Mesoamerican sweat lodge ceremony - far more than just a steam bath. The word means "house of heat" in Nahuatl.

### The Ritual

| Element | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **Structure** | Dome-shaped lodge (igloo-like) made of volcanic stone, clay, or wood - represents the womb of Mother Earth |
| **The Four Doors** | Ceremony divided into 4 parts (doors), each progressively hotter as new volcanic stones ("abuelas"/grandmothers) are added |
| **The Guide** | A temazcalero/a leads with songs, chants, meditation, drumming, prayers |
| **The Steam** | Water infused with medicinal herbs (sage, copal, local plants) poured over hot stones |
| **Duration** | 1-2 hours typically |

### What to Expect

**Physically:**
- Intense heat (especially in later rounds)
- Increased heart rate and sweating
- Possible dizziness - communicate if you feel unwell

**Emotionally:**
- Many experience emotional release - crying, laughter, deep introspection
- Can be profoundly moving
- Symbolizes death and rebirth

**After:**
- Feel refreshed, rejuvenated, emotionally cleansed
- Fresh fruit and agua fresca typically shared
- You may feel tired - allow time to rest

## Mushroom Tea & Guided Experiences

### Cabañas Pacífico (Tío's Place)

This is the original and most trusted spot - **"Tío"** opened it 20+ years ago.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **What** | Mushroom tea served at hilltop restaurant |
| **How** | Ask for "Hongo" - staff brings mushrooms or prepares tea |
| **Setting** | Stunning nature views, peaceful |
| **Guidance** | Follow instructions from the grandmother who serves |
| **Reputation** | "Pretty much the one place in town that is most trusted" |

### Critical Timing Note

**You're visiting late February/early March - this is OFF-SEASON for fresh mushrooms.**

| Season | Availability |
|--------|--------------|
| **July-October** | Fresh mushrooms, best quality, cheapest |
| **November-June** | Dried mushrooms, tea, or preserved in honey only |

**Your options in late February:**
1. Mushroom tea at Tío's (preserved in honey - most reliable off-season)
2. Focus on temazcal as the ceremonial experience
3. Consider this a reconnaissance trip and return July-October

### Mushroom Foraging Tours & Other Options

| Option | Details | Season |
|--------|---------|--------|

| **Coyote Aventuras** | 4-day guided retreats with ceremonies - only available June-July | Summer only |

### How to Find a Guide (Spanish Helps)

Speaking Spanish opens doors to guides that don't advertise to tourists:
1. **Ask at Cabañas Pacífico directly** - Staff know everyone
2. **Talk to locals in town** - Small community, word of mouth
3. **Check at the small tiendas** - Shop owners often know guides
4. **Be patient** - Trust is earned, especially off-season

### What's Available Off-Season

| Form | Availability | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Fresh mushrooms** | Not available | Season is July-October only |
| **Dried mushrooms** | Limited | Ask locally, quality varies |
| **Honey-preserved** | Most reliable | Tío's specializes in this |
| **Mushroom tea** | Available | Standard preparation at Tío's |
| **Chocolates** | Available | Cabañas Rubí offers these |

## Safety Information for Bipolar Disorder

**This section is critical if traveling with someone who has bipolar disorder.**

### What Medical Research Shows

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Risk level** | ~1 in 3 people with bipolar disorder who use psilocybin report adverse effects |
| **Types of adverse effects** | New or worsening manic symptoms, sleep difficulties, anxiety |
| **Clinical trials** | Have historically EXCLUDED people with bipolar disorder |
| **Recent research** | Small studies on Bipolar II show promise, but data is limited |

### Absolute Contraindications

| NEVER combine with | Why |
|--------------------|-----|
| **LITHIUM** | **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** - risk of seizures |
| **Antipsychotics** | Blocks effects, unpredictable interactions |
| **SSRIs/MAOIs** | Risk of serotonin syndrome |

### If Your Friend Is Considering This

1. **Consult their psychiatrist first** - this is non-negotiable
2. **Bipolar I vs Bipolar II matters** - Bipolar I carries higher risk
3. **Medication status** - any medication changes require medical supervision
4. **Professional supervision strongly recommended** - not a casual decision
5. **Have a plan** - know how to contact mental health provider if symptoms worsen

### Harm Reduction if Proceeding

- Start with very low dose if at all
- Have a completely sober trip sitter present
- Monitor carefully for emerging manic symptoms (reduced sleep, increased energy, impulsivity)
- Track mood changes in days/weeks following
- Do NOT proceed if currently in unstable mood state

### The Bottom Line

Research suggests **lower risk than previously assumed** for Bipolar II, but risk is **real and significant**. This should only be considered with:
- Medical consultation
- Professional supervision
- Proper preparation and integration support

**The temazcal is a powerful, meaningful ceremonial experience that doesn't carry these risks.** Consider making that the focus.
