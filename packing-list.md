# Packing List: One Carry-On for All Climates

[← Back to Main Plan](mexico-vacation-plan.md)

*13 days across volcano, city, cloud forest, and beach - all in one bag*

---

## The Strategy

| Environment | Temp Range | What You Need |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Toluca** | 40-70°F | Layers, warm hat for volcano |
| **Nevado de Toluca** | Below freezing at summit | All layers at once |
| **Oaxaca City** | 55-80°F | Light layers, walking clothes |
| **San José del Pacífico** | 50-70°F | Warm layers for misty nights |
| **Beach** | 75-90°F | Minimal - swimsuit, shorts, sandals |

**Key principle**: Merino wool + layers + quick-dry fabrics. Wear your bulkiest items on the plane.

## Laundry Strategy

You'll be on the road 13 days with ~7 days of underwear/socks. Options:

1. **Wash in sink** - Merino dries overnight, especially in dry Oaxaca climate
2. **Hotel laundry** - Available in Oaxaca City, cheap
3. **Lavandería** - Drop-off laundry services everywhere, ~$2-3/kg

**Best time to wash**: Oaxaca City (Days 5-7) - you're stationary for 3 nights.

## What NOT to Bring

| Skip This | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Jeans | Heavy, slow to dry, takes space |

| Bulky towel | Quick-dry travel towel is enough |
| Multiple pairs of shoes | 2-3 max |
| "Just in case" items | You can buy anything you need in Mexico |
